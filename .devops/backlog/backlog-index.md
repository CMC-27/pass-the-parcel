# 📋 Backlog Index

This index is the master queue of all proposed, deferred, or future work. It holds two things: the **Triage Panel** (what to do next) and the **Themes** table (where each theme's detail lives). Item detail — epics, features, completed rows — lives in the per-theme registers `t{n}-<slug>-backlog.md`; this index links out rather than duplicating it.

**Parked** plans live at `.devops/backlog/<code>-<slug>-backlog.md` (`type: backlog`, `claim_status: QUEUED`). Commitment into a sprint is `@sprint-plan`; the claim protocol in [`.devops/rules/plan-lifecycle.md`](../rules/plan-lifecycle.md) § Claim Protocol moves a committed plan into `.devops/plans/`. The `-backlog.md` suffix is shared with the theme registers — the front-matter `type` (`theme` vs `backlog`) is the discriminator.

> **Maturity, not queue.** Per-axis template maturity and next levers live in [`MATURITY.md`](MATURITY.md) — this index tracks work items; that register tracks how healthy each axis is.

> **Code quality is a separate lane.** Complexity/debt items live in [`REFACTORING.md`](./REFACTORING.md) — process-driven maintenance fed by the sprint-close scan, not roadmap work. Refactoring never enters the Triage Panel below.

## Triage Panel

| Tier | Code | Title | Size | Note |
|------|------|-------|------|------|
| 🔴 NOW | T1-E2.06 | Portable-surface fold review | M | **Ordering constraint: land before the next satellite pull** — otherwise the one machinery lesson a satellite authored (`[2026-09-16] A register row reading COMPLETE is a claim, not a measurement`) is erased by the merge-by-name overwrite of `.devops/rules/process-lessons.md`. F1 is independently shippable as a one-liner. Also: deletes two matured/stale register entries (F2), folds the exported-seam AC rule into `ptp-high-visionary` Phase 4 (F3), rescopes `@agent-wrap-up` Phase 7b's `machinery-version` bump to the template (F4), and documents the pull's merge-by-name semantics (F5). |

Tiers: 🔴 NOW · 🟡 NEXT · 🟢 LATER · ⚪ PARKED · ❄️ DEFERRED. Ordering rules live in `TRIAGE.md` (seed: `.devops/templates/TRIAGE.template.md`).

## Themes

| Theme | Name | Register |
|-------|------|----------|
| T1 | Parcel Pipeline Machinery | [t1-parcel-pipeline-machinery-backlog.md](./t1-parcel-pipeline-machinery-backlog.md) |
| T2 | Wiki System & Knowledge Layer | [t2-wiki-system-backlog.md](./t2-wiki-system-backlog.md) |
| T3 | Template Distribution & Onboarding | [t3-template-distribution-backlog.md](./t3-template-distribution-backlog.md) |

A theme register (`t{n}-<slug>-backlog.md`, front-matter `type: theme`) is the stable home for that theme's epics and features, both open and completed. The register is created when a new theme is first needed.
